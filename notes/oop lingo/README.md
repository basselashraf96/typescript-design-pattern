# What is the User of a Class?

The user of a class is the developer who is trying to use that class in a function, a method, or in another class.

# What is an Interface?

An interface is a bridge between the user and the system. It defines a contract that specifies the methods and properties a class must implement, without providing the implementation itself. This allows developers to interact with the system in a consistent and predictable way.
