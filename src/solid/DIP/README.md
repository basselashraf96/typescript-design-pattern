# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) ðŸ”„

## What is the Dependency Inversion Principle?

The **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** is one of the **five SOLID principles** of Object-Oriented Design (OOD).  
It states that **high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.**

Additionally, **abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.**

This means that instead of directly depending on specific implementations, classes should depend on interfaces or abstract classes.

**Analogy:** Imagine a **wall socket** âš¡.

- You can plug in a **charger for any device (phone, laptop, tablet)** because the **socket does not depend on the specific device**.
- The charger provides a **standardized interface** that allows different devices to connect without modifying the socket.
- Similarly, **DIP ensures that high-level logic depends on interfaces rather than concrete implementations.**

## Why Use DIP?

- âœ… **Reduces Tight Coupling** â€“ High-level modules remain independent of low-level details.
- âœ… **Improves Maintainability** â€“ Changes in low-level modules do not break high-level modules.
- âœ… **Encourages Flexibility** â€“ Switching implementations (e.g., replacing a database or payment provider) is easier.
- âœ… **Enhances Testability** â€“ Using abstractions allows for dependency injection and better unit testing.

## ðŸ”¥ Advantages of DIP

- ðŸ”¹ **Decouples High-Level and Low-Level Logic** â€“ Prevents direct dependencies on implementation details.
- ðŸ”¹ **Encourages Use of Interfaces & Abstractions** â€“ Promotes well-structured, extendable code.
- ðŸ”¹ **Simplifies Code Changes** â€“ New implementations can be introduced without modifying existing code.
- ðŸ”¹ **Supports Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** â€“ High-level code remains unchanged when new implementations are added.
