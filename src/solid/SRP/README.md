# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 📌

## What is the Single Responsibility Principle?  

The **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** is one of the **five SOLID principles** of Object-Oriented Design (OOD).  
It states that **a class should have only one reason to change**, meaning a class should be responsible for **only one thing**.  

**Analogy:** Think of a **restaurant chef** 🧑‍🍳. Their job is to cook food, not handle customer service or process payments.  
Similarly, a class should **focus on a single task** instead of performing multiple unrelated duties.  

## Why Use SRP?  

- ✅ **Improves Code Maintainability** – Changes in one part of the system don’t affect unrelated functionality.  
- ✅ **Enhances Readability** – Each class has a clear, well-defined purpose.  
- ✅ **Increases Scalability** – Easier to add new features without modifying existing code.  
- ✅ **Encourages Modularity** – Small, focused classes make debugging and testing more efficient.  

## 🔥 Advantages of SRP  

- 🔹 **Reduces Complexity** – Each class handles only one concern, making it easier to understand.  
- 🔹 **Minimizes Dependencies** – A focused class has fewer dependencies, leading to more stable code.  
- 🔹 **Simplifies Unit Testing** – Isolated responsibilities allow for targeted testing.  
- 🔹 **Enhances Code Reusability** – Well-structured classes can be easily reused across projects.
