# Open/Closed Principle (OCP) ðŸ”„

## What is the Open/Closed Principle?  

The **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** is one of the **five SOLID principles** of Object-Oriented Design (OOD).  
It states that **software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification**.  
This means we should be able to **add new functionality** without altering existing code, ensuring **stability and scalability**.

**Analogy:** Think of a **smartphone** ðŸ“±. You can install new apps (extend functionality) **without modifying** the phoneâ€™s operating system.  
Similarly, we should be able to **extend a classâ€™s behavior** without altering its existing implementation.

## Why Use OCP?  

- âœ… **Prevents Code Modification Risks** â€“ Reduces the chances of breaking existing functionality.  
- âœ… **Improves Maintainability** â€“ Existing classes remain unchanged, while new functionality is added separately.  
- âœ… **Encourages Scalability** â€“ Makes it easier to introduce new features without altering core logic.  
- âœ… **Supports Code Reusability** â€“ Promotes the use of inheritance and interfaces for flexible design.  

## ðŸ”¥ Advantages of OCP  

- ðŸ”¹ **Enhances Code Stability** â€“ Core components remain unchanged, reducing unintended bugs.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Simplifies Feature Additions** â€“ New behaviors can be introduced via extension, without altering the base code.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Encourages Modular Design** â€“ Keeps components independent and easily replaceable.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Reduces Code Coupling** â€“ Extending behavior through inheritance or interfaces prevents tight dependencies.
