# What is Abstraction in TypeScript?

Abstraction in TypeScript is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the essential features. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. This is typically achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.

# TypeORM: Abstraction in Database Management ðŸš€

## What is TypeORM?

TypeORM is a **modern Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library** for TypeScript and JavaScript. It **abstracts** database interactions, allowing developers to work with **high-level APIs** instead of raw SQL.

## Why Use TypeORM?

- âœ… **Simplifies Database Operations** â€“ Perform queries with clean, object-oriented code.
- âœ… **Encapsulates Complexity** â€“ Focus on business logic, not SQL queries.
- âœ… **Multi-Database Support** â€“ Compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.
- âœ… **Improves Maintainability** â€“ Use **decorators** to define entities and relationships clearly.

By abstracting away low-level database details, **TypeORM makes development faster, cleaner, and more scalable.** ðŸš€
