# Inheritance in Object-Oriented Design 🏗️

## What is Inheritance?  

Inheritance is a **core principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** that allows a class (**child/subclass**) to **inherit** properties and methods from another class (**parent/superclass**).  
This enables **code reuse, extensibility, and hierarchical relationships** between classes.

**Analogy:** Think of inheritance as a **family tree** where a child inherits characteristics from their parents.  
Similarly, a subclass can reuse and extend the functionality of a superclass **without rewriting code**.

## Why Use Inheritance?  

- ✅ **Code Reusability** – Common logic is defined once in the parent class and reused in subclasses.  
- ✅ **Extensibility** – New functionalities can be added to subclasses without modifying the parent class.  
- ✅ **Improved Maintainability** – Reduces code duplication, making code cleaner and easier to manage.  
- ✅ **Encourages Hierarchical Design** – Defines a clear relationship between general and specialized classes.
