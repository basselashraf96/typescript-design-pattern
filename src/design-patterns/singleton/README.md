# Singleton Design Pattern ðŸ”„

## What is the Singleton Design Pattern?

The **Singleton Design Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to control access to shared resources, such as a configuration object, database connection, or logging service, and ensure that only one instance of a class is created during the entire application's lifecycle.

### Analogy:

Imagine a **centralized logging system** where all parts of the application need to write to the same log file. The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the Logger class exists and provides a global point to access it.

## Why Use the Singleton Pattern?

- âœ… **Ensures One Instance** â€“ Guarantees that a class has only one instance, and provides a way to access it.
- âœ… **Global Access** â€“ The single instance can be accessed globally throughout the application.
- âœ… **Lazy Instantiation** â€“ The instance is created only when it's needed, which can save resources.
- âœ… **Control Over Resource Allocation** â€“ Useful for managing resources that should be shared (e.g., database connections).

## ðŸ”¥ Advantages of Singleton Pattern

- ðŸ”¹ **Prevents Multiple Instances** â€“ The pattern ensures that no more than one instance of a class is created, which can reduce memory consumption and avoid conflicting states.
- ðŸ”¹ **Global Access Point** â€“ Provides a global point of access to the unique instance, which can be used throughout the program.
- ðŸ”¹ **Controlled Access** â€“ You can control how the instance is created, which can be useful for initializing resources (like database connections).
- ðŸ”¹ **Lazy Initialization** â€“ The instance is created only when it is actually needed, rather than when the program starts, which can improve performance.

## When to Use Singleton Pattern?

- When you need to ensure that there is only **one instance** of a class.
- When the class needs to be accessed globally, but you want to restrict instantiation to one object.
- When controlling access to shared resources is important, such as a **database connection** or **logging service**.
