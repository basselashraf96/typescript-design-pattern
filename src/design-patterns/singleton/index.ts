/**  
 * ðŸŽ­ **Singleton Design Pattern!**  
 *  
 * The **Singleton Design Pattern** ensures that a class has **only one instance**.  
 * This instance is created only when it's needed, and is accessible globally.  
 *  
 * ðŸ”¹ **Single Instance** â†’ The class ensures that there is **only one instance** of the class throughout the application.  
 *    - This is useful when you need to control access to shared resources (e.g., database connection).  
 *  
 * ðŸ”¹ **Global Access** â†’ The unique instance can be accessed globally through a static method.  
 *    - Any part of the application can get access to this instance without creating a new one.  
 *  
 * ðŸš€ **Result:** The Singleton pattern helps to **save resources** and **manage shared states** efficiently,  
 * while ensuring a **single point of control** over the resource.
