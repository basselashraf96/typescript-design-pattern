/**  
 * ðŸŽ­ **Logger Class Using Singleton Design Pattern!**  
 *  
 * The `Logger` class is a perfect example of the **Singleton Design Pattern** in action.  
 * This class ensures that only one instance of the Logger exists, even if multiple parts of the application request it.  
 *  
 * ðŸ”¹ **Single Instance** â†’ There is **only one Logger instance** in the entire application.  
 * This ensures that logging messages are always handled by the same instance, preventing potential conflicts or duplicate logs.
 *  
 * ðŸ”¹ **Global Access** â†’ The `getInstance()` method provides global access to the single Logger instance,  
 * making it available anywhere in the application without the need to create a new one.
 *  
 * ðŸš€ **Result:** This Singleton pattern ensures that the logging system is consistent and efficient throughout the application.
