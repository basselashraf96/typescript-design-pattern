# Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Design ðŸ”’

## What is Encapsulation?  
Encapsulation is a **fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP)** that restricts direct access to an object's internal state. It ensures that data is only modified through **controlled methods**, preventing unintended modifications and improving maintainability.

## Why Use Encapsulation?  
- âœ… **Protects Data Integrity** â€“ Prevents accidental changes by restricting direct access.  
- âœ… **Enhances Maintainability** â€“ Changes to internal logic don't affect external code.  
- âœ… **Increases Code Reusability** â€“ Objects expose only necessary details, keeping the design clean.  
- âœ… **Encourages Modularity** â€“ Each class manages its own data, making the system more scalable.  

## Advantages of Encapsulation  
- ðŸ”¹ **Security** â€“ Sensitive data remains hidden and can only be accessed through predefined methods.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Improved Debugging** â€“ Errors are easier to locate since data manipulation is controlled.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Better Code Organization** â€“ Helps maintain a clear separation between an objectâ€™s data and behavior.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Flexible & Extensible Code** â€“ Changes can be made without breaking existing functionality.
